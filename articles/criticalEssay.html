            <p class="essaySubTitle">Introduction:</p>
            <p>Creating this website was a challenging experience for several reasons (mostly stubborn API’s). Several things needed to be considered, some should have been better planned and some went relatively well. In this essay, I will be discussing some key points about this website and the process of making it, including techniques and practices I tried to follow, a more in-depth look at the elements I used and some challenges I faced.</p>
                <p class="essaySubTitle">Web Technologies and Design Techniques:</p>
                <p>Viégas and Wattenberg’s (2007) piece ‘Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics’ Goes into depth on how data visualisations and their capabilities have broken down the barriers between scientific data and art. This has enabled artists and data analysts to display data in interesting, interactive and engaging ways. This is something that I have attempted to do, with varying success.</p>
                
                
                <p>Web technologies like the D3 library are an interesting study when it comes to data visualisations. It has enabled the normal person to create engaging data visualisations from their personal computers, and it enables anyone to tell data stories that can really make a difference. The data story in the analysis I did for my essay is a good example of this (can be found in the articles section). Using libraries like this to display data, helps make data accessible to more and more people, as it makes it easy to engage with and understand, granted the visualisation is done well. </p>
                <p>Using something like the D3 library to display data, has an interesting outcome for people more interested in the artistic side of things. Having made visualisations myself, I can safely say, that having nice to look at interactive visualisations makes for an enjoyable experience. It brings art from something that is often static or not something you can interact with (when not engaging with video games), to something that is interactable and makes the user an active participant in the creation of the visualisation. </p>
                
                <p>When looking at design techniques, it is something I have come to realise is extremely important. Using design techniques effectively in the creation of my website made me acutely aware of how many things need to be kept in mind. When following good practices, however, it makes keeping track of these things easier. </p>
                <p>I have found that it is extremely important to keep accessibility in mind when creating a website, as few things in this digital age are as frustrating as having to use a website that is hard to interact with, hard to use or just completely inaccessible. </p>
                
                <p class="essaySubTitle">UI/UX:</p>
                <p>I will be dividing my discussion on my UI and UX and how it creates meaning into two sections: the overall website, as most of these things integrate into one another and my data visualisations. </p>
                
                <p><em>Overall Website:</em></p>
                <p>The Homepage on my website is where most of the ‘magic’ happens. I decided to make the homepage the main hub for the main content of the website, as this is the first page that the user sees. It contains simple cards that when clicked, take the user to the relevant page. They are simply designed and get straight to the point. </p>
                <p>My homepage starts with an image, a logo and a slogan that sets the tone for the rest of the website: “Just Recipes. No Other Fluff”. I tried to keep the website consistent in the “no other fluff” section, as I felt this was the whole point of my website. Thus, there is very little clutter. The only thing to be found in the background is the watermark, so the website does not look too empty. I tried to use my space sparingly to keep the website feeling as uncluttered as possible. This is something I also tried to implement in each of the elements to be found on the website. The buttons are simple. The navigation buttons change colour when hovered over and when clicked, and all the other buttons slightly change in size. It creates an obvious sign that it is interactable, but it is subtle enough to not be overpowering to the senses. There are minimal images, they are only used when necessary, furthering the “no fluff” narrative, but also making loading times shorter. The header and footer are simple, with no unnecessary clutter and only provide the necessary information. </p>
                <p>Finally, the main part of my website that brings home the meaning and message of simplicity is the colour palette. I also used the colours to promote a more fun feel to the website, but the limited colour palette is what added to the main simplistic narrative. I chose colours with the aim to increase contrast for visibility but also focused on keeping it limited to reduce cognitive load. </p>
                <p>The colours are interesting, and the fonts are enjoyable to look at but still easy to read. It pulls the users in, with a moving arrow beckoning the user to keep looking.</p>
                <p><em>Data Visualisations:</em></p>
                <p>The data visualisation colours continue the theme of simplicity. They slightly vary, to increase contrast between the different elements, but they are in the same family. I wanted to keep the colours consistent with the rest of the website, so the visualisations did not feel out of place when first looking at them. I also tried to keep the visualisations relatively simple to keep on brand and to make them as easily understandable as possible. Admittedly, the UI and UX design on the data visualisations could be better.</p>
                
                <p class="essaySubTitle">Interactivity:</p>
                <p>In the overall sense of my project, interactivity is admittedly not something that can be implemented in every aspect. However, to make my website an enjoyable and actively engaging experience, I attempted to make my website interactive wherever I could.</p>
                <p>The first place I attempted to do this, is in the general navigation and use of my website. There are many elements on my website that are meant to feel engaging. When the user can interact with an element, there are two ways that tell them that they are able to do so. The first is in the act of hovering over certain elements. Buttons, links and cards that can be interacted with, have a reaction when the mouse hovers over them. They will either:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increase in size</li>
                        <li>Change colour</li>
                        <li>Fade into view</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>These are simplistic reactions, that fit into the simplistic feel of my website, but it makes the website feel reactive and alive.</p>
                <p>Then, there is the use of convention. Most internet users know what an input box looks like, and I attempted to capitalise on this, creating text input boxes that look like the text input you will see on many websites: rounded edges with a replacement text that prompts the user to fill in the relevant information. I also used convention by using checkboxes next to the ingredients in my recipes, encouraging the users to engage with the recipes as they use them. </p>
                <p>Secondly, I attempted to implement interactivity in my data visualisations. This is something I had more success with with my previous data visualisations using an API that provided fruit data. There I created one visualisation that compared the sugar content in the fruit to each other, which the user could split by clicking a button to view the lower to higher sugar content fruit separately while providing more data through tooltips, and another that compared the sugar content in fruit to coke. This fitted well with the theme of my website, and the article it was placed in and told a story to the user. However, since this API was no longer in use. I had to change course.</p>
                <p>After battling to find an API, I settled on using a completely different API and approaching the visualisations differently. Here the interactivity is a lot less, as the only interactive aspect is that the user can type in the Pokémon name, to see its data. There was a lot more I would have liked to implement, like tooltips and more interactivity. However, time and the ability to tame an API were not on my side, and this resulted in data visualisations that did not really fit into my website, visualisations that were not particularly interactive and a data story that did not make sense. I expand on the challenges I faced below.</p>


                <p class="essaySubTitle">Challenges:</p>
                <p>The biggest challenge I faced was when trying to implement my data visualisations. In the first iteration of this website, I was using an API that provided data on a list of fruits. This fits with the theme of my website perfectly. I was able to create visualisations, that I admit still needed work, but they were functional, and they made sense in the context of the website. The API, however, has been taken down since. This has caused me a list of problems. </p>
                <p>I did not have the time to redo the whole of my website, thus I needed to find an API that would work for my website. This was not possible, however. All the food-related APIs were either not suitable for the type of visualisations I would have liked to do, or I would only be able to access them if I paid an exorbitant amount of money. After a lot of frustration, I decided to use a different API and make it fit into my website as it is. This API would be the PokeAPI, which hosts data about all of the Pokémon in the Pokémon universe.</p>
                <p>This API, however, gave me a world of problems when trying to fetch the data. Because of this, I was unable to implement the visualisations I would have wanted to make (comparing the edibility of all the Pokémon), and I had to settle for visualisations that I personally feel are subpar. I had to make it work in the short timespan that was left, and thus, I was not able to make something that I was proud of.</p>
                <p>The final biggest challenge was time. I did not have enough of it. This will probably always be a big challenge when taking on big projects, especially when having to do other projects simultaneously. This project has taught me that even good time management skills leave room for improvement.</p>
                
                

                <p class="essaySubTitle">Professional Practices:</p>
                <p>There is a long list of best practices when it comes to web/app design. I understand I have not implemented every one of these, because I am still learning how to implement most of them. However, there are a few that I have implemented, as I understand how to, and think that they are important. (These practices are mentioned by Isra Delgado (2024) on the Duck Design site.)
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Good coding practices for screen readers</strong>: There are places that I can improve on this, as there are a few places I might have overused the ‘div’ element, however, in many cases I try my best to implement good syntax to make it easier for screen readers to access. This makes it easier for people who suffer from visual impairment to be able to access my website, making it a more inclusive space. </li>
                        <li><strong>Alt text of images</strong>: I ensure that I include alternative text on all my images. This makes it possible to still interact with my website, even when images cannot load. This is also something that screed readers can access to make my website more accessible to the visually impaired. </li>
                        <li><strong>Colour contrast</strong>: When choosing my colours, I ensure that I keep within a simple colour palette that is contrasting enough for any text to be readable over any colour. Colour contrast also means that people who struggle with colour blindness can easily access my website, and not have a problem seeing any of the coloured elements.</li>
                        <li><strong>ARIA labels</strong>: I attempted to add ARIA labels in every place I could, to make it more accessible to those with disabilities. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="essaySubTitle">Conclusion:</p>
                <p>In conclusion, finalising this website was quite a challenge. There are several elements that I am unhappy with and would love to fix. However, there are some things I set out to do that were relatively successful. I am looking forward to learning more about data visualisations and hopefully figuring out how to get APIs to work.</p>
