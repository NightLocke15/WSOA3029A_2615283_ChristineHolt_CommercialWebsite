            <p class="essaySubTitle">Project Overview:</p>
            <p>The data journalism piece I chose is <cite><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/detroit-segregation-wall/">“Built to keep Black from white”</a></cite> by Erin Einhorn and
                Olivia Lewis on July 19, 2021. It discusses the wall built in a Detroit neighbourhood to
                separate an area of land into a ‘black’ and ‘white’ neighbourhood, and how this has
                contributed to the division between American citizens. The article goes into detail on how,
                why and who built this wall, and the effect of segregation on the city, with the help of
                interactive data visualisations.</p>
                <p class="essaySubTitle">Visualisation Techniques:</p>
                <p>This article has three main data visualisations accompanied by contextualising text and
                    images. The three visualisations are made up of geographical maps, each with a different
                    purpose. Maps are an extremely versatile form of data visualisation, as they can represent
                    various types of geographical data in different ways <cite><a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/data-visualization-types/">(Hillier, 2021)</a></cite>.</p>

                    <figcaption>Figure 1: The first map showcasing where the Birwood Wall is located and what its purpose was.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>The first map shows a map of Detroit, with a red line named the “Birwood Wall” and text
                    that scrolls up on the right, contextualizing the visualisation. As the viewer keeps scrolling,
                    the text changes and the map moves into the Eight Mile-Wyoming neighbourhood where the
                    wall is located. The visualisation moves even closer, moving into an orthographic view,
                    showing the buildings in grey, and the wall in red. An area on the map is highlighted in
                    yellow, showing the side of the neighbourhood that was originally classified as a ‘black
                    neighbourhood’. The visual changes the camera orientation, highlighting the other area in
                    blue, showing the side developed as a ‘white neighbourhood’.</p>
                <p>This first visual starts the data story using simple graphics, and two distinguishable colours,
                    blue and yellow. It gives the reader important context for the wall and its purpose to separate
                    the neighbourhoods. The scrolling text on the right provides information on the visuals
                    displayed. Together, this visualisation informs the reader of the situation without
                    overwhelming them with information.</p>

                    <figcaption>Figure 2: Second map that shows the red-lined areas of Detroit.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The second map starts by showing the Eight Mile-Wyoming neighbourhood, then zooms out
                    as the user scrolls to show the red-lined areas of Detroit through red-highlighting on the map.
                    This is accompanied by more scrolling text contextualising the visualisation. It tells us that
                    these areas were not federally funded. The visualisation scrolls back into Eight Mile-
                    Wyoming, where most of the area is highlighted in red. There is a red dot, highlighting the
                    Crew family home. The text gives us more context to the purpose of the wall, stating that
                    “Federal policies encouraged builders to physically separate new developments from redlined
                    areas” (Einhorn & Lewis, 2021).</p>
                <p>This second map gives the reader further context on the reasons for the wall being put up.
                    The visual gives only relevant context in the text snippets and images while showing the
                    disadvantaged areas in red. The red contrasts with the white and grey map, driving home the
                    effect the policies had on these areas.</p>
                <p>In researching the emotions evoked by colour, <cite><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2041669520902484">Jonauskaite et al. (2020)</a></cite> showed that in a
                    group of participants, 73% associated red with anger. The second visual, using red as the
                    colour to highlight these areas, plays on these emotions when combined with the content of
                    the article.</p>

                        <figcaption>Figure 4: This is the map found at the end of the third one that showcases the average home value in the different areas of
                            Detroit.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                <p>The third and final map shows a zoomed-out view of Detroit, with a key showing a blue,
                    yellow and grey dot. Each dot represents 10 people, blue represents white people, yellow
                    represents black people and grey represents other demographics. The visual starts with
                    Detroit in the 1930s and progresses by approximately 20 years every time the user scrolls. It
                    shows the spread of the population, and it shows which areas had a bigger black or white
                    community. This map clearly shows the division between these demographics throughout the
                    years, with the yellow dots most concentrated within the original city lines, and the blue dots
                    spanning over most of the suburbs. It then finally switches over to another map of Detroit that
                    showcases the average home values across Detroit.</p>
                <p>This visual effectively shows: (1) How segregation caused problems over the last 90 years,
                    and (2) How this segregation has negatively impacted minority groups, especially black
                    people. It does this by using the same blue and yellow as previously mentioned, creating
                    continuity and repetition. The colour difference is striking, effectively conveying the facts. It
                    gives enough information to provides context but lets the data speak for itself, making it more
                    memorable for the reader.</p>
                <p>Showcasing the data on maps is an effective choice for this article. As this article is focused
                    on a specific area in a specific city, using a different form of data visualisation might have
                    detached the data from the area it is tied to. The maps tie the data to this area, helping the
                    reader understand what they are reading and driving home its importance.</p>
                <p class="essaySubTitle">Interactivity/User Engagement:</p>
                <p>The way the user interacts with the data visualisations is through scrolling. Each time the user
                    scrolls, new information is presented, whether through text snippets or a change in the
                    graphics.</p>
                <p>Interactivity can be an extremely effective manner to convey information memorably.
                    Interactive elements help garner more attention to the information, help the user understand
                    the content better and help them remember the information better <cite><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.046">(Xu & Sundar, 2016)</a></cite>.</p>
                <p>I initially thought that more interactive elements were needed in these visualisations, such as
                    tooltips when hovering over certain points. However, I do not think this is the case. As
                    <cite>Knaflic (2015)</cite> states, the best graph, or in our case, data visualisation to use is “… whichever
                    will be easiest for your audience to read.” The visualisations in this article are easy to read
                    and understand, while still being interactive and dynamic. For this article, I feel as if the data
                    visualisations are well thought out and well chosen.</p>
                <p>I don’t have much experience with data visualisations, but it is evident that less is better.
                    Reading Chapters 2 and 3 from Knaflic’s (2015) Storytelling with Data: A visualization guide
                    for business professionals, has taught me a lot about how to simplify your data
                    representations and the information conveyed to make them easier to understand and read by
                    choosing the correct visualisation and avoiding clutter as much as possible (Knaflic, 2015).
                    This means that the user will receive what is needed without confusion. This made it possible
                    for me to see when visualisation has been done well and enabled me to see the importance
                    and effectiveness of the data in this article.</p>
                <p class="essaySubTitle">UI/UX Design Principles:</p>
                <p>There is a long list of places where the UI and UX were done well in this article. A few are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>User consideration: the topics covered in this article are quite complex. The data
                            visualisations cover the facts in simple terms, making it easily understandable.</li>
                        <li>Purpose of the visualisations: The purpose of these visualisations is clear from the
                            start. They are telling a story about the segregation situation in Detroit. This is kept
                            consistent and clear throughout the whole article.</li>
                        <li>Simplicity: The visualisations are interactive, yes, but they are not complicated, not in
                            interaction or information. This reduces the cognitive load on the reader significantly,
                            making the information more memorable.</li>
                        <li>Consistent: The visualisations are all cohesive, using the same or similar elements and
                            colours to convey the required information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="essaySubTitle">Storytelling:</p>
                <p>Knaflic (2015) writes about using this simple three-act structure to convey data in a story-like
                    fashion. This means the story often has a clear beginning, middle and end.</p>
                <p>The data story of segregation in Detroit starts with introducing the Birwood Wall and its
                    purpose. It further explains the areas around the wall using text and colour. This visualisation
                    gives the relevant information in a simplistic way introducing and setting the story into
                    motion.</p>
                <p>In the middle part of the story, the data provides further context on the segregation situation
                    in Detroit, making it clear that policies encouraged the separation of these areas. It develops
                    the situation in the story further by telling the user what happened and how in short text
                    snippets and visual representations.</p>
                <p>The final part of the story showcases the spread of people throughout the city over the last
                    ninety years and concludes with the average home values of these areas in 2021. The spread
                    of people makes the segregation in the 1930s blatantly clear. There is a clear trend from there
                    on in the following years. This shows the consequences of the policies implemented back in
                    the 1930s, and how they still affect the city today. This is the ending to a story with good
                    narrative flow, where it shows a clear progression from beginning to end, repeating important
                    information throughout.</p>
                <p>Using stories to portray data can be very powerful in conveying memorable information.
                    Stories can be leveraged to pull people in and convey information more effectively than just
                    providing facts (Knaflic, 2015). This article tells a story in two ways: (1) through written text
                    and (2) through data visualisations. These two aspects work together to convey the facts
                    efficiently and very effectively.</p>
                <p>For my work, I hope to be able to tell a story in the same manner, by using each element to
                    strengthen the next. This case study showed me how important it is to keep the user and the
                    goal of the article in mind when creating data visualisations. My visualisations would must be
                    simple, but still convey the most important information to ensure understanding and impact.</p>
                <p class="essaySubTitle">Conclusion:</p>
                <p>In conclusion, this was a good example of how to choose and implement data visualisations.
                    Each visualisation was connected to the previous in some way, and together they created a
                    cohesive and easily understandable data story. Just looking at the data visualisations will
                    provide the user with a clear indication of what the article is about and the topics that are
                    covered. They are memorable and impactful, and together with the text, this article conveys
                    its message effectively using data and visuals that aim to inform with facts.</p>
