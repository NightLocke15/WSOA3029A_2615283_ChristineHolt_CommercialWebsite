                <div class="text">
                    <p>1. <u>Website Name and Logo</u>: The website name is “Step 1” in reference to the steps followed when following a recipe. It is simple, and humorous, already setting the more relaxed tone of the rest of the website. This section will also serve the same purpose as the home button in the navigation, as it will take the user back to the home page. </p>
                    <p>2. <u>Navigation</u>: The navigation buttons are in the same font as the logo, to give some continuity and help further the relaxed feel of the website. The font used for the logo is also quite legible, so it does not cause problems for readability. When the user is on the page that the navigation button is linked to, the button has a salmon pink background with white text to separate it from the other buttons and help the user keep track of where they are in the website. The other buttons have a dark maroon colour with a white background. When the user hovers over the button with their mouse, the background changes to the same colour as the current page button. </p>
                    <p>3. <u>Logo and Slogan</u>: The first thing on the website is an image of jam (something you definitely need a recipe to make) by Pixaby on the Pexels website. On top of this is the website name and logo, as well as a section with a white background that serves as the website slogan. It helps the user understand that the website is mainly about recipes, and only recipes, no extra essays on unnecessary things. </p>
                    <p>4. <u>Downward arrow</u>: This will serve as a guide, telling the user to scroll down in order to see the rest of the page and what the website offers. It will move up and down</p>
                    <p>5. <u>Recipe Section</u>: This section introduces the first and main aspect of the website, the recipes. The user can access these recipes clicking on the card, that will take them to the page that contains all the recipes available on the website.</p>
                    <p>6. <u>Articles Section</u>: This section offers additional aspects of the website, the articles. Clicking the card takes the user to the article page that contains the articles available on the page. </p>
                    <p>7. <u>Post a Recipe Section</u>: This final section lets the user know that they can use the website to post their own recipes, by sending the recipe to the creators. Clicking the card takes the user to a page where they can fill in their recipe and details in order to send it to the creators so they can add it to the recipe archives.</p>
                    <p>8. <u>Further Notes on above sections</u>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>These sections tell the user in quick and small sections what the website can be used for. They are short and small and easy to digest, also giving easy access to each section.</li>
                        <li>These sections are separated by salmon pink borders, with dark maroon headings, buttons and separators. </li>
                        <li>These sections will fade in as the user scrolls down.</li>
                    </ul> </p>
                    <p>9. <u>Background</u>: The background has light pink leaves. The watermark is to break up the bright white colour of the background to make it easier to look at for the user.</p>
                    <p>10. <u>Footer</u>: The footer is made up of a salmon pink background with white text representing the links to the different sections in the website. The footer is static at the bottom of the screen, as the header stays on the screen constantly, thus the footer does not need to be accessed at all times. When the user hovers over the different links the backgrounds change to a slightly lighter color to indicate that they are interactable.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>11. <u>Search bar</u>: The search bar enables the user to search for a specific recipe they are looking for (If they can’t find one they want, they can always send a suggestion!)</p>
                    <p>12. <u>Filter Buttons</u>: These buttons filter the list of recipes into the different categories of recipes available on the website. When a filter button is pressed, the background will change colour and stay that colour, to constantly remind the user what category they are currently on. When the buttons are hovered over, the backgrounds will also change to the colour. </p>
                    <p>13. <u>Recipe</u>: All the recipes will have a salmon pink coloured border, an image of the food the recipe is for, the name of the recipe and the approximate time it will take to make. This gives the user the basic information about the recipe, and a basic idea of what they should expect. When the user hovers over a recipe, the size of the thumbnail will increase slightly, and the colour of the border will change.</p>

                    <p>16. <u>Post a Recipe Page</u>: This page enables the user to send a recipe to the creator, that after review, might be added to the archives of recipes on the website. This page gives a short description explaining the purpose to the user. </p>
                    <p>17. <u>Post a Recipe</u>: The user can submit a recipe. They have to fill in their name, their email address and the message they want to send. If not all of the fields are entered, the message cannot be submitted, and the form will show the user that this is the case through a message. (It does not actually send anything at this stage.)</p>
                    <p>18. <u>Submit Button</u>: When the user submits their form, the form will either confirm that everything is correct, or an error message wil pop up in the relevant place. I chose to stick with text, to make it as clear as possible, and to try and avoid confusion. </p>

                    <p>19. <u>Hover article</u>: When the user hovers over the article they want to select, the section increases in size slightly, as well as the text inside. The border also changes to the darker colour.</p>
                    <p>20. <u>Article</u>: The articles have a border around them that is a salmon pink colour. The heading is a dark maroon colour, and bigger in size (Also the same font as all the other headings in the website) and the other text is smaller and darker. The paragraph beneath the heading gives the user a small description of the article in order to let them know what the article is about. This final article will contain my essay. I though that the articles page might be a suitable place to keep it.</p>

                    <p>22. <u>Data Visualisations</u>: The data visualisations will have a salmon pink border around them in order to separate them from the rest of the article, and so they have a clear container. </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All text will be Left aligned for ease of use and readability (Except some titles, where center alligned works better).</li>
                    <li>Minimal images will be used for simplicity and to avoid overwhelming the user.</li>
                    <li>The text for all headings is the Life Savers Google font.</li>
                    <li>All other text is the Roboto Google font.</li>
                    <li>The colour scheme was chosen for it’s contrast to each other, but also to match the relaxed and cute feel of the website. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="subTitle">Style Guide</p>
            <div class="wireframeContainer"><img class="styleGuide" src="../images/Styleguide.png" alt="Style guide that shows the decisions made for each styling decision in the website" title="Style Guide">
            </div>
            <p>Text on Style Guide:
                <ul>
                    <li>Typography
                        <ul>
                            <li>All the headings will be the Life Savers font. It is quite readable, so users should not struggle to read it, but it is a more stylized font, so it will not be used for larger pieces of text.</li>
                            <li>Any content that will be made up of larger pieces of text will use the Roboto font. It is an easily readable font, but it does not give a serious feel (as it is on the rounder and smoother side), that fits into the style of the website very well. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Colour Palette
                        <ul>
                            <li>The while colour will be used for the background and any text found on a darker background.</li>
                            <li>The salmon pink is mainly used for highlighting when the mouse hovers over buttons, as well as for borders around elements like recipes an articles.</li>
                            <li>The Maroon colour is used for headings as well as for borders around text and borders around elements that are hovered over.</li>
                            <li>The dark navy colour is used for content that is mainly made up of text.</li>
                            <li>I chose these colours because they contrast well against each other, making them easy to differentiate. Below the colour palette is how people with different levels of colour blindness see them, and they still have good contrast against each other. The two darker colours are more similar, but they are never used on top of one another for this reason.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Branding
                        <ul>
                            <li>The branding is on the simpler side. I did not see the need to have a specific logo, as the name is short and simple enough to use it as a logo. There are also not many images that are directly involved with the branding, but the image on the main page fits the colour palette quite well, as it uses similar colours. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Interactive Elements
                        <ol>
                            <li>The navigation bar is at the top of the page. When hovering over the buttons, their backgrounds become salmon pink.</li>
                            <li>The filter buttons filter the recipes on the recipe page into different categories. These backgrounds also change colour when hovered over, and the buttons background turns pink when clicked on. The search bar enables user to search for specific recipes.</li>
                            <li>All the buttons are a maroon colour with white text and they enlarge when hovered over.</li>
                            <li>Recipes and articles have pink coloured borders, but enlarge and the borders become dark when the element is hovered over.</li>
                            <li>The footer has a background of salmon pink, and text in white. Their backgrounds become lighter when they are hovered over. </li>
                            <li>These input elements enable the user to add their information and send a recipe to be added to the archives. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Other Design Decisions
                        <ul>
                            <li>The website is intentionally simple, to fit with its purpose of providing recipes without extra unnecessary information.</li>
                            <li>The colour palette is simple but contrasting enough to make it easy to use. </li>
                            <li>There are minimal images, they are only found in specific places, to make loading the website easier, and to avoid cognitive overload (The same with the colour palette and style of the website)</li>
                            <li>The website is meant to be more relaxed and fun, and the colours and font styles show this.</li>
                            <li>There are not many sharp corners in the website, again, to give a softer less serious feel. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="subTitle">What I was unable to implement:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I was not able to implement all the datavisualisations or visualise them the way I wanted to. Because the original API I was using (FruityVice) no longer works, I had to fins a different API to use. This proved extremely difficult, as there was either no API that contained the dat I would need, or it is an API I would need to pay to be able to use. Because of this, and the fact that I would not be able to restart the website I made, I decided to use something completely different, the PokeAPI. I wanted to make a funny visualisation to do with the edibility of pokemon, and compare them to each other. This, however, proved very dificult with the time I had and my current abilities. Thus, I implemented the data visualisations that are currently on this website, and I can safely say that I am unhappy with them. But it was what I was able to implement with the time I had.</li>
                
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="subTitle">Data Visualisation Choices:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I chose the PokeAPI, and used the data to the best of my ability, and tried to theme it to my website.</li>
                        <li>I wanted to use a visualisation that compares the edibility of each pokemon, but this turned out te be quite hard.</li>
                        <li>In the first visualisation each stat is represented by a different colour.</li>
                        <li>The other visualisation calculates how many portions of food you would get from the chosen pokemon. I chose the colour I chose because it was contrasting to the background and it is easier to view.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
