                <p>I love cooking. I am not all that good at it though, and thus, I need to follow recipes when I do decide to do it.
                I am also very easily distracted, so I need recipes to be concise and without fluff, which is not something I am often able to find in the
                wonderful world we call the internet. I often have to scroll through troves of unnecessary information to get to the actual recipe. This 
                makes wanting to learn how to make new things hard a lot of the time.</p>
                
                <p>My name is Christine and I really wanted a recipe website where I can find a recipe with only the necessary details, like the ingredients and 
                the instructions. That is why I made this website, so I can share some of my and other's favourite recipes by only giving the relevant information. 
                This will remain a free website and it will act as an archive for any recipes I come accross or that is shared with me. I hope you enjoy 
            and find this website useful. Happy Cooking!!</p>

                <p>This website is designed to be simple and without fluff. The colours were chosen to perpetuate the more relaxed and fun feeling of the website. 
                    It is used as a platform to provide access to recipes without irrelevant information, as well as articles that provide further information on 
                    foods and other things, backed with facts and mixed with a few opinions. The fonts were specifically chosen for their readabulity, but also for 
                    the non-serious feel they give off. Further information on each of the design choices in the website can be found on the designs page below.
